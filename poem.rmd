## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
(The Knights Song)  
  
I'll tell thee everything I can:    
There's little to relate.    
I saw an aged aged man,    
A-sitting on a gate.    
'Who are you, aged man?' I said.  
  
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
(Stars)    
How countlessly they congregate    
O'er our tumultuous snow,    
Which flows in shapes as tall as trees    
When wintry winds do blow!--    
As if with keenness for our fate,   
  
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,    
Shining with all his might:    
He did his very best to make    
The billows smooth and bright â€”    
And this was odd, because it was    
The middle of the night.  
  
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In shadows deep, Rune did roam,  
Through haunted lands, he sought his home.  
With heart unyielding, small in frame,  
He braved the dark, fueled by his aim.  

Through whispering woods and moonlit glades,  
He ventured forth, through ghostly shades.  
In treacherous mountains, he did climb,  
Scaling peaks with relentless prime.  

In cryptic tombs, he faced the past,  
Unearthed the secrets that would not last.  
The fabled prize, his heart did yearn,  
A crown of kings, a power to discern.  

But as he neared the final test,  
A darkness loomed, his soul distressed.  
A spectral touch, a chilling breath,  
The dance of death, the touch of death.  

Oh, Rune of yore, your quest so grand,  
Cut short by fate's unyielding hand.  
In our hearts, your legend will dwell,  
A dwarf who dared, a tale to tell.  

Through shadows deep, your name shall thrive,  
In whispered verses that will survive.  
In depths unknown, your spirit abides,  
Rune, the dwarf on his epic stride.
