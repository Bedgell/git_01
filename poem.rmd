In shadows deep, Rune did roam,  
Through haunted lands, he sought his home.  
With heart unyielding, small in frame,  
He braved the dark, fueled by his aim.  

Through whispering woods and moonlit glades,  
He ventured forth, through ghostly shades.  
In treacherous mountains, he did climb,  
Scaling peaks with relentless prime.  

In cryptic tombs, he faced the past,  
Unearthed the secrets that would not last.  
The fabled prize, his heart did yearn,  
A crown of kings, a power to discern.  

But as he neared the final test,  
A darkness loomed, his soul distressed.  
A spectral touch, a chilling breath,  
The dance of death, the touch of death.  

Oh, Rune of yore, your quest so grand,  
Cut short by fate's unyielding hand.  
In our hearts, your legend will dwell,  
A dwarf who dared, a tale to tell.  

Through shadows deep, your name shall thrive,  
In whispered verses that will survive.  
In depths unknown, your spirit abides,  
Rune, the dwarf on his epic stride.
